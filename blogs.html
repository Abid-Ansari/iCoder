          <h1 class="display-4 fst-italic">My Struggle with Engineering</h1>
          <p class="lead my-3">It all started with a dream that I used to saw in my higher secondary classes that
            one day I will make some amazing electronic stuff that no one has seen earlier.I took a lot of interest in electronic
            gadgets around me and used to wonder what is the science behind them. I was very much curious about how all these telecommuncation
            system works. How we are able to call or message someone through mobile phone.What is this word used so much called "Network"?
            Since I was from PCM stream, I knew that I am going to do engineering in my coming future. Then I realized that Electronics and Communication
            branch will be the most suitable for me as far as my interest is concerned (to be very honest I even didn't knew that what is the
            syllabus of ECE or what are its subjects or what I will learn in this stream LOL..It was just a fascinating word for me to be called
            as an ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNNICATION engineer......haahaaaaa).
            So now my 12th boards exam were over, and what now? I have to face the engineering entrance exam JEE Main.I knew that I am not going
            to perform well since I was not prepared to face such an all India level test or even if I will qualify it I am not going to get any 
            college through it. So , I gave it just casually and also my performance was bad as expected but I qualified it (cutoffs are not that 
            high). But it was indeed a pleasure moment for my family that I have qualified such a competitive exam even without taking any extra 
            coaching (again haha..).Then my family convinced me to give a try on JEE Advanced.
             <br><br>
            
             The reputation of JEE Advanced is known to every Indian.
            It is one of the most difficult examination of not only India but the whole world.I strongly believe that the reason behind why IITians are
            celebrated in our society is because of JEE Advanced since it needs a very strong perseverance and hard-work to crack this prestigious
            exam.Only about 1 percent of the million students who give JEE finally end up in IIT. I write JEE Advanced and as expected I got the result that 
            I am not qualified.The JEE Advanced authority again released the result by lowering the cutoffs and I qualified it..xD.Haha, it was I think probably
            the first time that JEE Advanced result were released twice.But I was not able to get anything with this result also. So, I just took a drop to prepare
            for JEE in a full-fledged manner.
            Let's not go deep into that because that is in itself a massive experience.
            So after a year I again sat for JEE Advanced and this I qualified it with a decent rank AIR-7546 (though it does not seem to be that great but a 
            JEE aspirant can definitely understand..xD).So,after all the counselling and physical registration process, I finally landed up in the Indian Institue of 
            Technology (ISM) Dhanbad  and here we go, I got Electronics and Communication branch....something that I wished for earlier. From here, the real things come
            into play.Now the story begins...xD.

         s

            <br><br>
            To be very honest, I didn't have any idea about my college and the place Dhanbad.Suddenly, my life took a 360 degree turn. I was far far away from my family
            in a totally unknown place.During school time I was an extremely introvert guy(which I really regret now..LOL).I was too shy natured to talk to a girl in my school
            days.(It actually makes me burst into laughter whenever I think of it now).So carrying forward, I knew it is going to be little bit difficult for me to become
            interactive and make friends.It was lot because of my room partner I learn to socialise with people as he was very outspoken, kind and a supportive guy. He is one of my
            best friends of college.Gradually I become very comfortable in the college.There are a lot of things that I can add over here but I think now
            it's time for some spoiler.
            
            <br><br>

            As our academics started, the real picture of college comes into place. I am not a supporter of my college academics which is bounded my shitty assignments,
            strict deadlines and the cruel and fucking behaviour of so called "Professors". I don't even wish to call them as Professors. They are actually the most wild creatures
            of our college campus (I wish none of my college administration people are reading it).I don't think they have some sense or anything to teach students who actually belong 
            to top 1% of students of our country.They don't took any interest in teaching students and helping them by solving their queries.They are just like a puppet who are told 
            to perform just "this and that act" to teach....this is this and that is called that..and nothing more than that.They just want to complete their syllabus and put heavy assignments
            and say "I will fail you".These men have so much power that they can even ruin the entire engineering life of a student.Bloody nonsense idiots.I am not just saying this out of frustrations
            or anything but stating some harsh facts that not known to any outsiders who assumes IIT to be a wonder land.(I am not criticising IIT but some of it's culture).I have some very 
            terrible experience in my academics.Suddenly from a school topper to a college flopper...does not feel good for sure. (but I was not the only one ... :) ).My encounter with engineering drawing 
            was something that I will not forget ever.I was extremely poor in ED.(and my roomie too..xD).I just hated it like anything.(no offence to anyone who loves ED).I passed it anyhow and it was extremely 
            satisfying to see C+ grade...Haha..(as I was worried of getting backlog...LOL).

            <br><br>
            I have few interactions with my seniors.One that I would like to mention about is during the Icebreakers session of our branch where my seniors asked me do a mimicry
            of a professor,some fun games and  acts, one of which was to do a ramp walk with a girl...xD.

            <br><br>
            Then after my second semester started and everything was going in very nice this time.I scored very well in mid semester exam this time. I was even the topper of my section
            in Chemistry which felt so nice.Then our mid semester break happened and then to everyones surprise..Corona pandemic started...and from their actually sufferring started.I have not
            been to my college for more than 1.5 years.We will cover the next in another blog.
